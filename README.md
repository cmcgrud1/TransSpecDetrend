# TransSpecDetrend
Codes used to detrend ground-based transmission spectral data.

These codes take 2D spectra data extracted from a pipeline specific for the telescope and instrument to a final reduced transmission spectrum.

A thorough description of the routine and reasoning behind its development can be seen in the paper that originally implemented it: McGruder et. el. 2022 (ADS link: https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164..134M/abstract).

This routine was used for reducing
1.	Magellan/IMACS data of HATS-29b and VLT/FORS2 data of WASP-124b in McGruder et. el. in prep;
2.	Magellan/IMACS data of WASP-25b and WASP-124b and NTT/FOSC2 data of WASP-25b in McGruder et. el. 2023 (ADS link: [https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023AJ....166..120M/abstract](url));
3.	Magellan/IMACS and VLT/FORS2 data of WASP-96b in McGruder et. el. 2022 (ADS link: [https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164..134M/abstract](url))
